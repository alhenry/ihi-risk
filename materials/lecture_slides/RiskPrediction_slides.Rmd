# Learning objectives

- Describe the difference between __deterministic__ and __probabilistic__ methods for prediction

- Create __2x2 contigency table__

- Explain how __ROC curves__ are calculated and how they relate to __sensitivity__ and __specificity__

- Understand key measures to evaluate __model performance__ 

---
# The problem

.small[
Consider individuals in which a certain __binary event Y__ might
happen (0=no, 1=yes) by a certain point in time. 
We also have a set of other variables for each individual.

Some examples:
- A group of patients about to have a surgery: Some will __develop complications after the surgery__ and some will not. We have data on their age, sex , severity of disease, comorbidities etc.

- A group of pregnant women: some will __have a child with a malformation__ , some will not. We have data on the mothers ’ age , medications, diagnostics, life style, etc.

In all these cases we do not know for sure which individuals will get the event.
]

---
# What we want to do
Ideally we would like to predict who is __going to develop the event__. This can be done in two ways:
- __Deterministic:__

  **Classify** each individual in one of the two possible outcomes: develop the event or not.
  This is often used in __(Supervised) Machine Learning__
- __Probabilistic:__
  
  Assign each individual a **probability** of developing the event. ( This is often used in __Biostatistics__ and is known as **Risk Prediction**
  
Both strategies use data we collected for each individual (age, sex, diagnoses, etc.)

---
## Example
__Who will develop myocardial infarction in the next 5 years?__

Consider we have the following data

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
# kable <- function(df, ...){
#   kable(df, align = "c", ...) %>% 
#     kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "striped"),
#                 full_width = T, font_size = 20)
# }

df <- tibble(id = 1:10,
             age = c(35, 35, 55, 55, 65, 65, 75, 75, 85, 85),
             sex = c("F", "M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "M", "F", "F", "M") %>%
               factor(levels = c("F", "M")),
             diabet = c("Yes", "No", "No", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "No"),
             SBP = c(145, 130, 115, 170, 135, 140, 160, 130, 130, 160),
             Classify = c("No", "No", "No", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "Yes"),
             Predict = c(0.15, 0.05, 0.10, 0.55, 0.30, 0.52, 0.60, 0.40, 0.55, 0.60),
             Observed = c("No", "No", "No", "No", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "No", "Yes", "Yes")) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(diabet, Classify, Observed),
            factor, levels = c("Yes", "No"))


df %>%
  mutate(Classify = NA, Predict = NA, Observed = NA) %>% 
  kable(align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "striped"),
                full_width = T, font_size = 20) %>% 
  row_spec(0, background = "#bbbbbb")
  # row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#") %>% 

```

---
## Classify deterministically

Use previous algorithm:

`C(age, sex, diabet, SBP) = 0 or 1`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df %>%
  mutate(Predict = NA, Observed = NA) %>% 
  kable(align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "striped"),
                full_width = T, font_size = 20) %>% 
  row_spec(0, background = "#bbbbbb") %>% 
  column_spec(6, color = accent, bold = T)
  # row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#") %>% 

```
---
## Predict probabilistically

Use previous algorithm:

`P(age, sex, diabet, SBP) = [0, 1]`

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df %>%
  mutate(Classify = NA, Observed = NA) %>% 
  kable(align = "c") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "striped"),
                full_width = T, font_size = 20) %>% 
  row_spec(0, background = "#bbbbbb") %>% 
  column_spec(7, color = accent, bold = T)
  # row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#") %>% 

```
---
## Observe
... after 5 years follow-up

Compare predictions with observed events

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df %>%
  kable(align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "striped"),
                full_width = T, font_size = 20) %>% 
  row_spec(0, background = "#bbbbbb") %>% 
  column_spec(6:8, color = accent, bold = T)
  # row_spec(1, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#") %>% 

```

---
## Model validation

.large[
* Our models have predicted some individuals well but not others

* We want to have a general measure of how good or bad our algorithms are by
__comparing the predictions with the actual observed values__.

* This will be done differently for a classification algorithm than for a prediction
algorithm.

### AUC as a measure of model discrimination

![](https://github.com/dariyasydykova/open_projects/blob/master/ROC_animation/animations/ROC.gif?raw=true)

.footnote[by Dariya Sydykova ([follow link for more info](https://github.com/dariyasydykova/open_projects/tree/master/ROC_animation))]
---
### What does AUC tell us?

* AUC can be interpreted as the __probability that an observed “yes ” was assigned a higher probability than an observed “no”__

* If the model was __useless__ (same as assigning probabilities “at random”),
then an observed “yes” would have only 50% chances of having higher predicted risk than an observed “no” (__AUC = 0.5__)

* __AUC = 1__ for a model that would give higher predictions to all the
observed “yes” than to all the observed “no ” (__perfect separation__ between “yes” and “no”).

* Any real world model will have __AUC between 0.5 and 1__. Closer to 1 indicates better performance in separating "yes" and "no".

* For binary classification, AUC is equal to __concordance (C) statistic__

---
### How do we come up with predictions?

* We propose a statistical model for the __probability of the event happening__
$P\left(Y_{i}=1\right)$ depending on the other variables 

* For example a __logistic model__:

$$\log \left(\frac{P\left(Y_{i}=1\right)}{1-P\left(Y_{i}=1\right)}\right)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} X_{i}+\beta_{2} Z_{i}+\cdots \tag{1}$$

* We need a __training set__ where we can observe all the variables $Y_{i}, X_{i}, Z_{i}, \ldots$
to estimate the __coefficients__ $\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}, \beta_{2}, \dots$

* Once we have the coefficients that best fit the data we can __calculate the predicted risk for each individual__ $i$

$$\widehat{P}\left(Y_{i}=1\right)=\frac{e^{\widehat{\beta}_{0}+\widehat{\beta}_{1} X_{i}+\widehat{\beta}_{2} Z_{i}+\cdots}}{1+e^{\widehat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1} X_{i}+\hat{\beta}_{2} Z_{i}+\cdots}} \tag{2}$$

.small[
### Model validation

#### Internal validation

* The validity of claims for the underlying __population that the data originated from__ __(reproducibility)__

* __Split sample validation__: split dataset randomly into __training__ (for model development) and __test__ set (for validation)
<br/>👉 __.red[today's practical]__

* Other methods: __cross validation__ and __bootstrap__ resampling

#### External validation
* Generalizability of claims to __‘plausibly related’ populations__ not included in the initial study population __(transportability)__

* e.g. __temporal__ or __geographical__ validation

### A larger example with 2000 individuals

We will use the variables `Age, Sex, SBP, and BMI` to predict if the person will be `Dead = 0` or `Alive = 1` in 5 years time

Stata command:

`logistic dead age sex sbp bmi`

Note that BMI is not statistically significant (`P = 0.185`) but let's stay with this model for now

### Make predictions from Model _M1_

Create variable: __logit of the probability of death__ - __equation (1)__

`predict m1lp, xb`

![:scale 60%](figure/stata_roc_1.png)

__`AUC = 0.78`__
]

There is a 78% probability that a person that actually
dies gets a higher predicted risk by the model than a person
that did not die by the end of the follow up

### Sensitivity and Specificity for model _M1_ <br/> by cut-off value

.center[![:scale 65%](figure/stata_sensSpec_1.png)]

Plotting __sensitivity and specificity against cut-off value__ can help to
select the most appropriate cut-off

In practice, this trade-off often needs to be decided on a __case-by-case__ basis

## For discussion

Consider the following scenarios:

* Screening for diabetes & pre-diabetes

* Diagnosing coeliac disease

* Screening suspect for coronavirus infection COVID-2019

<br/>
Which model would you choose:

1. High-sensitivity, low-specificity

2. Low-sensitivity, high-specificity

#### Key measures to evaluate __model performance__

__Calibration__
* The agreement between the predicted & observed outcomes
* For a group of patients with 10% predicted risk, do 10% experience the event?
* e.g. Goodness of fit test

__Discrimination__
* The ability of the model to distinguish between "event" and "non-event"
* e.g. AUC / C statistic

__Clinical usefulness__
* Does the model provide accurate predictions at the patient level that can be used to guide clinical decision making?
* e.g. [Decision curve analysis](http://www.decisioncurveanalysis.org/)

## Summary

* Prediction modelling can be broadly categorised into __deterministic__ and __probabilistic__ methods

* __2 x 2 contigency table / confusion matrix__ is useful as a first step to evaluate model performance

* __AUC__ is a useful measure of the model __discrimination__

* Comparing observed and predicted risks is useful for model __calibration__

* Assessing __clinical usefulness__ requires other approaches and often requires insights from ___beyond the data___
